# The yard AR tool: research and build plan

Written by the core session, 2026-11-01, at the owner's request, and rebuilt
twice the same day as the owner set the priorities. The core session builds it
(a core-owned tool, not a features or water session tool). This file is the
build spec. Keep it current as phases land, and record measured results in
"Findings" at the bottom, HARD apart from SPECULATION, the same way
docs/DETECTOR-FINDINGS.md does.

## 0. What the owner asked for, in their words

The request:

> "i wanted you to spearhead it as a new tool with a common codebase that can be
> shared between the maps for their respective purposes. Ideally it would be a
> new tool accessible from the dashboard that scans the lawn environment and
> allows users to place gutters, sprinkler heads, and refines the data that was
> acquired from the lidar. Even better, it'd be awesome if it could even refine,
> or wholly substitute, the initial lawn mapper by finding lawn within the
> property line."

The first priority:

> "at the core of this, the original intended use is as a way to place
> sprinkler heads on the lawn. Because A. Placing dots on a map is tricky, a
> sprinkler in the middle of a lawn is just not visible from aerial imagery. B.
> We tried GPS, walk the lawn and press "place a sprinkler here" but that was
> terribly inaccurate. So... The ability to walk the lawn, point to the
> sprinkler with the cursor and tap "add a head here" is really the original
> point. Everything beyond that is a bonus, but a potentially huge bonus that
> be be smoothest if it could all work in one session of walking the lawn"

Live AR is required, and iPhone is in:

> "the other thing I wanted to do, eventually, was to have a viewer that allows
> the user to walk the lawn and inspect specific areas based on the output of
> the shade map and water map. So basically, real time ar is crucial."
>
> "It looks like 8th wall and slam support Safari in iPhones. Slam is not open
> source, but it's free. Vps is gone, but we could calibrate the initial
> location with 2 reference points, while maintaining the fix by referencing
> 3dep. Worst case scenario, if my research was wrong and 8th wall doesn't
> actually support Safari, iPhone users can still download the Mozilla web xr
> app"

And on the water session's first AR walks:

> "That point about drift because of looking around only applies to that first
> attempt with ARcore. I think there were other issues with our implementation,
> so don't take that as a given fact."

So the water session's H65-H67 results are **measured outcomes of one early
page**, not proof of what limits phone AR. Their causes are SPECULATION here.

## 1. The short version

- **One live AR page for both phones.** Open it on the lawn, the camera shows
  the yard with a crosshair. Put the crosshair on a head, tap "add a head
  here", and the head appears where you aimed, live, in place.
- **Tracking:** Android uses Chrome's WebXR (ARCore). iPhone uses 8th Wall's
  free SLAM engine, which runs in Safari. Both sit behind one small interface,
  so the rest of the code does not care which phone it is on. If 8th Wall fails
  on an iPhone, the fallback is Mozilla's WebXR Viewer app (old, see 2.3).
- **Where am I on the map:**
  1. **Start:** mark two reference points (the owner's idea). They are chosen
     from the lidar where possible (house corners, which do not lean or move),
     shown in the AR view to aim at, rather than tapped on the aerial photo.
  2. **Keep the fix:** every second or two, what the phone sees (walls, fences,
     trunks, the ground's shape) is matched against the 3DEP lidar, and the fix
     is nudged. Android has a depth picture for this (the water session built
     the match in H68). iPhone uses 8th Wall's 3D feature points instead.
  3. **More references any time:** a third or fourth point improves the fix.
- **Then the viewer:** the same page draws the shade map's and water map's
  results on the real lawn: sun hours, dry and wet spots, sprinkler coverage,
  where water runs and pools. Each map provides its own layers through a shared
  layer format (3.4).
- **The bonuses ride along:** the page also keeps a picture every half metre
  with its camera position. Those pictures can later build a 3D model of the
  yard (fences, trunks, fine ground, the lawn's edge, a splat to look at), and
  can sharpen every tap after the walk. None of that needs a second walk, and
  none of it is needed for heads.
- Niantic's location service (VPS) is gone from 8th Wall and native-only
  elsewhere, so it is not used.

## 2. What the research found

### 2.1 8th Wall (open source since Feb 2026)

- The open-source engine is MIT and covers image targets, face effects and sky.
  It has no SLAM.
- **SLAM ships in the free "Distributed Engine Binary"** (Jan 2026, xr.js),
  loaded from our own pages (a script tag or a copy in our files). Commercial
  use is allowed as part of a larger app. The license notice at the top of
  xr.js must stay, unmodified, and a credits screen must show the copyright
  notice and a link to the LICENSE (github.com/8thwall/engine). Not under
  active development, so a future iOS could break it and nobody would fix it.
- 8th Wall's whole history is AR in mobile browsers, iPhone Safari included,
  and its engine lists "Absolute Scale". **Whether today's binary runs well on
  the owner's iPhone is the first thing to prove** (phase 1).
- World tracking gives a camera pose every frame and a hit test that returns
  3D points of type FEATURE_POINT, ESTIMATED_SURFACE or DETECTED_SURFACE
  (XR8.XrController.hitTest). The feature points are what the iPhone feeds to
  the 3DEP match. It works with three.js.
- Not included: VPS, Lightship Maps, the Geospatial Browser, hand tracking.

### 2.2 Niantic Spatial (VPS, Scaniverse, SPZ)

- Pricing (nianticspatial.com/en/pricing, read 2026-11-01): Free plan $0 with
  about 1,500 VPS queries a month; Plus $20 a month; Pro $50 a month.
- VPS needs a VPS map of each place, built from a scan of that place. The SDK
  (NSDK 4.0, Apr 2026) is Unity, Swift, Android and ROS 2. **No web SDK.**
- **Scaniverse** (iPhone app): free on-device splats, exports PLY or SPZ. Splats
  are metric scale but not georeferenced. A possible import later (phase 6).
- **SPZ** is Niantic's open splat format, about 10x smaller than PLY.

### 2.3 Phone platforms

- **iPhone Safari:** no WebXR (no immersive-ar, no ARKit from the browser).
  AR in Safari comes from engines that do their own tracking from the camera
  and motion sensors, which is what 8th Wall's SLAM is.
- **Mozilla WebXR Viewer** (iPhone app, a browser with WebXR on ARKit): still
  listed on the App Store, but last updated around 2020, described by Mozilla
  as experimental and "not an officially supported Mozilla application". A
  fallback to test once, not a foundation.
  (apps.apple.com/app/id1295998056, github.com/mozilla-mobile/webxr-ios)
- **Android Chrome:** WebXR immersive-ar with hit-test, anchors, depth sensing
  and camera access, all four confirmed on the owner's S21 (water H68).
- **ARCore Geospatial / Streetscape:** native apps only.

### 2.4 Splats in the browser (bonus)

- **Spark** (sparkjs.dev, MIT): a three.js splat renderer for PLY, SPZ and
  others; WebGL2; built for phones.
- Training splats in the browser (Splat.js, Brush) exists on WebGPU; too heavy
  for a phone over a yard today.

### 2.5 What this repository already has (code read, 2026-11-01)

- No three.js, splats, 8th Wall or Niantic anywhere. 3D is raw WebGL
  (public/shade/view3d.js, water/public/view3d.js).
- **The water session's AR test page** (water/public/ar.js, water/lib/ar-align.js,
  water/lib/ar-lidar.js, water/public/ar-lidar-worker.js; admin only, Android):
  references marked on the photo and in AR, a fit that tells a slide from a
  turn, the phone's scale held per phone, anchors, and (H68) a fix from the
  phone's depth picture matched to the lidar, built but not yet walked. Its
  results stay in localStorage. The water session has agreed (2026-11-01) to
  hold new features on it until this tool exists, and to let its code be
  carried into scan/lib with those four files named as the source.
- **Measured on that page** (water/FINDINGS.md; outcomes, not causes): the
  phone measured distances 3.6% and 4.4% short on two walks; check points
  0.01-2.56 m off; anchors moved 0.19-0.67 m, one 21 m; reference dots tapped
  on the photo disagreed by up to 1.3 m; a head aimed from 14 ft landed 7 ft
  off. The owner's 2016 county lidar has about 3 points a square metre and no
  building or tree classes; the house is found by the water map's roof rule.
- **The shade map's 3D model** is rebuilt from lidar each visit, not saved.
  Frame: x, y in EPSG:3857 metres, z in real metres; real metres = mercator
  metres x cos(lat). shade/align.js gives a `shift` lining lidar up with the
  photo, saved in `tools.shade.data.lidar`. shade/ground.js makes the ground.
- **The map record (docs/MAPS.md):** lawn `shapes` and `parcel`; fences in
  `tools.shade.data.fences`; heads in `tools.water.data.irrigation.heads[].at`
  ([lng,lat]); gutters in `tools.water.data.gutters` and `downspouts`. A tool
  part is at most 64 KB and written only by its own tool. The dashboard lists a
  tool from `TOOLS` in worker/src/unified.js.

## 3. The design

### 3.1 One tracking interface, two engines (lib/track.js)

```
            page code (aim, tap, draw layers)
                         |
                  lib/track.js
          pose each frame, hit test, points seen
             /                          \
   WebXR engine                     8th Wall engine
   Android Chrome (ARCore)          iPhone Safari (SLAM in xr.js)
   + depth picture, anchors         + feature points
             \                          /
          Mozilla WebXR Viewer on iPhone uses the WebXR engine
```

- The interface gives: the camera pose each frame in the session's own frame
  (metres, y up), a hit test at the crosshair (the ground, or the nearest
  surface), the 3D points around the phone (depth on Android, feature points on
  iPhone), tracking state (good, limited, lost, reset), and the camera picture.
- Rendering is three.js on top of either engine.
- Phase 1 also runs 8th Wall on the Android phone, to compare the two engines
  on the same lawn.

### 3.2 Where am I on the map (lib/locate.js)

Two frames: the session's (where the phone started) and the map's (EPSG:3857
metres, the shade frame). The fix is the turn, shift and, if measured, scale
between them.

1. **Two references to start.** The page offers candidates from the lidar:
   house corners from the roof outline (pulled in for the eaves, as the water
   map's roof rule does), plus driveway or patio corners the user picks on the
   photo if the house is not handy. The user aims at each and taps. Two points
   give the turn and the shift. Scale comes from the tracking engine; with a
   third point it is checked, and the page reports it.
2. **Keeping the fix with 3DEP.** Every 1-2 s, the last stretch of what the
   phone has seen (points 0.25-2.5 m above the ground: walls, fences, trunks,
   shrubs; and the ground's own shape) is gridded and searched against the
   same grid from the lidar, starting from the current fix. A new fix is taken
   only when most of the points land and no clearly different fit is nearly as
   good (the H68 rules). It is applied smoothly so pins do not jump.
   Android: the depth picture (H68's code, carried over). iPhone: 8th Wall's
   feature points, collected by hit tests over a grid of screen points each
   frame. Whether feature points are dense enough is a phase 2 question.
3. **References any time.** "Mark a reference" stays on screen; each new
   one improves the fit. A reference far back in the walk counts for less, so
   an old error does not hold the fix (the water page's walk weighting is the
   starting point; its numbers are to be re-measured, not assumed).
4. **Watching the fix.** The page shows its confidence. Lost tracking or an
   engine reset puts it in "re-mark one reference" mode. Each tap stores the
   fix's state at that moment.

### 3.3 Placing things (lib/place.js)

- Tap kinds: sprinkler head, valve box, downspout foot, fence end or corner,
  tree trunk, and a check point (a known spot, not used in the fit, to measure
  accuracy).
- A tap stores: the map position from the live fix; the session position;
  the hit type; the aim distance; the fix's confidence; and the picture plus
  the crosshair pixel (so the tap can be sharpened later, 3.6).
- Aim distance matters: the page warns when aiming from far away (H67's 14 ft
  case) and suggests stepping closer.
- Gutters without aiming into the air: tap each downspout's foot; the gutters
  come from the roof edge the lidar has, and are shown in AR to confirm.

### 3.4 The viewer: shade and water on the real lawn (lib/layers.js)

- A **layer** is a georeferenced thing to draw on or above the ground: a
  raster on the ground (sun hours in a month, soil moisture, water-table depth,
  sprinkler coverage), lines (flow paths, gutters), points (heads with their
  spray arcs), or volumes (tree crowns, fences).
- Each tool supplies its own layers from its own part of the map record or
  its own public routes, in one small shared format, so the AR page draws them
  without knowing what they mean. The shade and water sessions own what their
  layers say and how they are computed; the format is agreed with them.
- Layers are draped on the lidar ground (shade/ground.js heights) so they hug
  the slope, and hidden behind the house and trees using the lidar's solid
  cells (drawn invisibly to block what is behind them).
- A tap on the lawn in viewer mode shows that spot's numbers (e.g. "5.2 sun
  hours in June, 0.6 in of water short this week").

### 3.5 Where it lives and how the maps share it

- **A folder of its own: `scan/`**, its own Worker at `scan.<home>` (domain
  from vars.CUSTOM_DOMAIN at deploy time, as tools/home-prepare.js does), its
  own deploy workflow, reaching `/api/maps/*` over a service binding as the
  water Worker does, and an R2 bucket for pictures made by CI
  (tools/ci-prepare.js pattern).
- **Shared library `scan/lib/*.js`**, plain ES modules, served at
  `https://scan.<home>/lib/<file>.js` with CORS: `track.js`, `locate.js`,
  `place.js`, `layers.js`, `frames.js` (map, session, lng/lat and local metre
  conversions, matching water/lib/ar-align.js and shade/ept.js), `lidar.js`
  (the lot's cloud gridded for the match, carried from ar-lidar.js).
- **Vendored libraries** in scan/vendor/ at exact versions: three.js, the 8th
  Wall xr.js with its notice intact, later Spark. A credits screen links the
  8th Wall LICENSE.
- **The map record:** the tool writes only `tools.scan.data`: the placed taps
  (heads, downspouts, etc. with [lng,lat] and confidence), the reference
  points, the walks (date, phone, engine, fix quality), all under 64 KB.
  Pictures live in R2 under the owner's key.
- **Each tool keeps its own part.** The water map imports
  `tools.scan.data.heads` into `tools.water.data` with a button it builds (the
  water session has agreed and wants the heads' shape once settled). The
  shade map may later read trunks and fences the same way.
- **Dashboard entry** in worker/src/unified.js TOOLS (core-owned):
  `{ id: 'scan', name: 'Yard AR', needs: ['shade'], url: 'https://scan.{home}/?map={id}', note: 'Experimental.' }`
  (needs the shade map because that is where the lot's lidar and its photo
  shift come from), admin-only until phase 3's test passes. Also linked from
  the water map's heads card (asked of the water session).

### 3.6 The bonuses from the same walk (later)

- **Sharpen every tap after the walk.** The kept pictures, with their camera
  poses, are solved together after the walk (bundle adjustment), and each tap
  is recomputed from its picture and pixel. Optional: only if live accuracy
  falls short. Needs a server (Modal, which costs money: ask first with a
  measured cost) or an on-phone solver.
- **A 3D model of the yard** from the same pictures: fences (line and height),
  trunks and crown edges, ground heights every 10-20 cm, the lawn's edge inside
  the property line (offered to the lawn mapper as a suggestion, never over the
  user's trace), and a splat to look at. Only where the walk went.
- **Scaniverse import** (PLY/SPZ) lined up with the lidar the same way.

### 3.7 The other sessions

- **Water session:** agreed to everything in 2026-11-01's message (hold the AR
  test page, code carried with sources named, heads imported into
  tools.water.data). Tell them the heads' shape when settled, and agree the
  layer format with them before phase 4.
- **Features session (shade):** agree the layer format; later, trunks and
  fences from the scan. They own public/shade*.
- Both are reached by a one-time scheduled Routine (CLAUDE.md).

### 3.8 Privacy and security

- Pictures of someone's yard and house are private to the map's owner: R2 keys
  by owner, served only to them, never public, never in the repository, never
  used for training without an explicit opt-in, deleted once used (7 days at
  most).
- GPS is a rough start only, kept as the fix, not as a track.
- No addresses in the repository, logs or findings (CLAUDE.md).
- Upload limits and type checks on everything the page sends.

## 4. Phases, each with a done test

Each phase stays admin-only until its test passes on a real yard, and its
result goes in the Findings.

1. **Tracking on both phones.** scan/ folder, Worker, deploy workflow, R2 via
   CI, the dashboard entry (admin). track.js with both engines. A bare page:
   camera, crosshair, hit-test dot, a pin you can drop.
   *Done when:* on the owner's lot, 8th Wall tracks in iPhone Safari, WebXR
   tracks on the S21 (and 8th Wall there too, for comparison); a pin dropped
   on a spot, walked away from 20 m and back, is still on the spot. The
   distance between two taped marks 10 m apart reads within 2% on each
   engine. If 8th Wall fails on iPhone: try Mozilla's WebXR Viewer and report.
2. **Locate.** Two references from the lidar's house corners, the 3DEP match
   on both phones, the fix's confidence on screen, check points.
   *Done when:* five check points spread over the lot (taped from house
   corners) read within 0.3 m on both phones, after a full walk of the yard.
3. **Heads.** Tap kinds, saving in `tools.scan.data`, the water map's import
   (water session).
   *Done when:* the owner's heads, placed in one walk, are within 0.3 m of
   tape-measured spots, on both phones.
4. **The viewer.** The layer format agreed with the shade and water sessions;
   their layers drawn on the lawn, draped and hidden behind the house.
   *Done when:* the owner walks the lot with shade and water layers on and the
   layers stay put on the lawn (within 0.5 m) for the whole walk.
5. **Sharpen after the walk** (only if 2-3 fall short; server cost asked
   first).
6. **The 3D model bonuses**: fences, trunks, fine ground, lawn edge, splat,
   Scaniverse import.

## 5. Decisions for the owner

None blocking phase 1. Later:
- A paid server for sharpening taps or building the 3D model (phases 5-6):
  only if needed, with a measured cost first.

## 6. Open questions to settle by measuring, not arguing

- Does 8th Wall's binary track as well as ARCore outdoors on grass? On the
  owner's iPhone, at all? (Phase 1.)
- Are 8th Wall's feature points dense enough to match against 3DEP, without a
  depth picture? (Phase 2.)
- Does a 2016 cloud at 3 points a square metre carry the match where the yard
  has changed since (new fence, removed tree)? The house should.
- Lidar ground is the soil; a phone sees the grass top, a few cm higher. Does
  that matter for the match? Probably not; measure.

## Findings

None yet. Record each measured result here: HARD (measured, with the yard
named only as "the owner's lot" or by its lng,lat map id, never an address)
apart from SPECULATION.
