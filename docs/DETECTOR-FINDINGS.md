# What we know about training a lawn detector

**This file is the memory. Read it before configuring a training run, choosing
a backbone, or interpreting a result — and add to it after every run.**

Nothing here is written from recollection. Every HARD FINDING is a number this
repository produced, from a workflow run whose log can be found again, or a
citation with a link. Everything else is labelled SPECULATION and is not to be
repeated as though it were established.

The distinction matters more than usual here because the measurement is noisy
(see H7) and because two "fixes" have already been argued for on the strength
of a theory that later measured as nothing.

---

## Legend

- **HARD FINDING** — measured here, or cited with a link. Repeatable.
- **SPECULATION** — a theory that fits the evidence and has not been tested.
  It may be worth acting on. It is not worth asserting.

Every finding carries the date and the corpus it came from, because the corpus
changes and results from different corpora are not comparable.

## The numbers that matter right now

| | error | notes |
|---|---|---|
| SAM (what we pay for) | **20.3%** | the line to beat, 19 lawns with a stored SAM answer |
| best of ours | **28.2%** | Scale-MAE 896px, **the pretrained eye ALONE** |

Gap: **1.4×**. It was 1.5× at 672px and 1.6× under DINOv2.

---

## HARD FINDINGS — our own measurements

### H1. Our imagery is 5–38 cm per grid cell, typically 10–15 cm
*Computed 2026-09-19 from the frame-fitting arithmetic, not measured from a
file.* The frame is fitted to the parcel and scored on a 512 grid, so the
ground sample distance varies with lot size:

```
2,656 sq ft lawn   ~25 m frame   ->   5 cm per cell
16,487 (typical)   ~63 m frame   ->  12 cm
22,484 (Kent)      ~73 m frame   ->  14 cm
158,451 (largest) ~194 m frame   ->  38 cm
```

This is the single most decisive fact about backbone choice, because almost
every remote-sensing backbone is trained an order of magnitude coarser.

### H2. A ground-pretrained backbone reads this imagery badly
*Run 35404198905, 2026-09-18, 24 lawns, DINOv2 tiled at 224px.*
Eye-only **48.5%** against colour-only **34.5%** — 14.0 points worse. Adding it
to colour made things worse than colour alone (37.1% vs 34.5%).

### H3. A satellite-pretrained, scale-aware backbone reads it far better
*Run 35409315409, 2026-09-19, 23 lawns, Scale-MAE large at 672px.*
Eye-only **36.4%** against colour-only **32.9%** — 3.5 points worse.

**The gap to colour closed from 14.0 points to 3.5.** That is much larger than
the noise floor in H7 and is the strongest result this project has.

It is still *worse* than colour alone on its own — but combining now helps for
the first time: "both" 31.2% beats colour alone 32.9%. Under DINOv2 it never
did.

### H4. The ring (neighbourhood sampling) has no consistent effect
Measured three times. **Negative twice, mildly positive once, and the tool
called the positive one "within noise" itself.**

| run | ring result |
|---|---|
| DINOv2 224px, 24 lawns | colour+ring **43.7%** vs colour **34.5%** — 9.2 WORSE |
| Scale-MAE 672px, 23 lawns | "everything visible 3.8 points worse, and inferred areas no better. The ring is costing and not paying." |
| Scale-MAE 896px, 23 lawns | both+ring **32.1%** vs both **34.6%** — 2.5 BETTER; tool: "inferred areas 3.5 points better, everything visible 3.1 points better — within noise." |

**Do not read the 896 run as vindication.** The tool prints an encouraging
sentence next to that row ("this is the result the ring was built for"), and
the same paragraph says the movement is within noise. Given H7's floor, a
2.5-point swing is not a result.

The honest summary: across three runs the ring has no stable sign. It is not
established as harmful and it is not established as useful.

See also E3 — the published result saying receptive field alone is not the
lever for occlusion.

**SPECULATION (S6):** the ring may only be able to help once the centre
features are good enough to be worth contextualising, which would explain why
its best showing is on the run with the best backbone. Untested, and exactly
the kind of story that sounds right and has twice measured as nothing.

### H5. A wider squeeze of the backbone's output helps
- *DINOv2:* 96 numbers a patch **34.0%** vs 32 numbers **37.1%**.
- *Scale-MAE:* 96 numbers **30.9%** vs 32 numbers **31.2%**.

Consistent in direction across both backbones. The effect is much smaller under
Scale-MAE, which may mean the 32-number squeeze was mostly discarding DINOv2's
noise rather than signal.

### H6. Marked "inferred" ground is only about 3% of a typical map
*23 lawns, 2026-09-19.* 17 of 23 maps carry inferred marks. Marked ground is
**3% of a typical map, 44% of the most-marked**.

At 3% the inferred error column is measuring a few thousand pixels per lawn.
Its swings between configurations (17.8% to 53.5% in one run) are not currently
readable as signal.

### H7. THE NOISE FLOOR IS LARGE: one map is worth up to 10 points
*The most important methodological finding here, and the newest.*

Between the DINOv2 run (24 lawns) and the Scale-MAE run (23 lawns), one map was
rejected. Two of the six configurations use **no backbone at all**, so their
entire change is the corpus change:

```
colour and texture only      34.5% -> 32.9%    +1.6 points
colour, with surroundings    43.7% -> 33.2%   +10.5 points
```

**Removing a single map moved backbone-free configurations by between 1.6 and
10.5 points, depending on configuration.**

Consequences, and these are rules rather than observations:

1. Never compare two runs on different corpora without checking a
   backbone-free row first. It is the control.
2. Differences under ~10 points between configurations are not conclusive at
   this corpus size.
3. The lawn-set fingerprint printed by the tool exists for exactly this. Use it.

### H9. RESOLUTION IS A REAL LEVER — 896px beat 672px, cleanly
*Runs 35409315409 and 35411040880, 2026-09-19, same 23 lawns, same fingerprint
`14a2t7k`, Scale-MAE large at 672px then 896px.*

**This is the cleanest experiment this project has run**, because the
backbone-free control came back byte-identical:

```
                            672px   896px
colour and texture only     32.9%   32.9%   +0.0   <- CONTROL, unchanged
the pretrained eye only     36.4%   28.2%   -8.2
both                        31.2%   34.6%   +3.4
both, 96 numbers a patch    30.9%   32.4%   +1.5
colour, with surroundings   33.2%   35.7%   +2.5
both, with surroundings     33.8%   32.1%   -1.7
```

The control moving 0.0 points means the corpus, the split and the seed are all
identical. Every other difference **is** the resolution.

Two findings, and the second is as interesting as the first:

1. **The eye alone improved 8.2 points, from 36.4% to 28.2%** — far outside
   the noise floor, and for the first time it **beats colour alone** (32.9%).
   The tool's verdict flipped branches accordingly: *"it is reading things
   colour cannot."* This confirms S1: we were starving a scale-aware backbone
   of the resolution we actually have.

2. **Every combined row got WORSE.** "both" went 31.2% → 34.6%; "both, 96
   numbers" went 30.9% → 32.4%. Adding colour to a better eye made things
   worse. **This is unexplained.** See S7.

### H10. The backbone-free control is reproducible to the decimal
*Runs 35409315409 (672px), 35411040880 (896px) and 35416318719 (workflow 12,
DINOv2 tiled 224px), all 23 lawns, fingerprint `14a2t7k`.*

"Colour and texture only" came back at **32.9%** in all three — across two
workflows, two languages and three backbone settings, because none of them
touch that row. The corpus, the split and the seed are deterministic.

That is what makes H9's comparison valid, and it is the check to run first on
any future result: **if the control has moved, the corpus moved, and nothing
else in the table is comparable to anything before it** (H7).

It also bounds the noise claim usefully. H7's ±10 points is the cost of
CHANGING THE CORPUS, not run-to-run variance. At a fixed corpus this is exact.

### H8. Two maps dominated the error, and one was rejected for it
*DINOv2 run, 24 lawns.* An NC map measured **309.1% wrong** (SAM: 164.2%) — both
wildly over-predicting, which points at the map rather than the model. Rejected
by the owner on 2026-09-19.

A Kent map at **84.6% wrong** (SAM: 382.0%) was **kept deliberately**. The owner's
reasoning, which is the benchmark's whole value: *the majority of the property
is unambiguously woods, some of the lawn is ambiguous (shade and tree lines,
but not overhanging), and most of it is clearly lawn.* Being far too high or
too low there is a good read on real performance.

**Treat that Kent map as a benchmark, not as a problem to remove.**

## HARD FINDINGS — external, cited

### E1. Scale-MAE beats SatMAE on segmentation
By **0.9 mIoU**; ConvMAE by 1.3; vanilla MAE by 1.0. Same pretraining data
(fMoW-RGB), so there is no case for SatMAE over Scale-MAE.
[Scale-MAE, ICCV 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14532)

### E2. Scale-MAE is conditioned on ground sample distance
It is handed the ground distance a pixel covers and builds its position
encoding from it. Its advantage over SatMAE and ConvMAE **grows** as the GSD
departs from what it trained on. This is why it suits us despite H1, and why
the frame dump writes `scale.json` and the run refuses to guess.

### E3. Bigger receptive fields do NOT solve occlusion
*The published result on our exact problem — inferring what is under tree
canopy.* A U-Net gets **84% recall on unoccluded roads, 63.5% on roads under
canopy**. Architectures with much larger receptive fields barely differ
(DeepLabV3+ ResNet-50: 63.9%). Recall falls to **30–40%** for occluded pixels
furthest from anything visible.

> "Expanding receptive fields alone does not meaningfully enhance the ability
> to reason about hidden road segments. Models remain heavily biased toward
> local features."

[Seeing the roads through the trees](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.06762v1) ·
[ChesapeakeRSC](https://github.com/isaaccorley/chesapeakersc)

This is the independent corroboration of H4.

### E4. There is no free lawn model
Searched 2026-09-19. The turfgrass deep-learning literature is **ground-level**
weed detection in turf. Roboflow "lawn and grass" sets are ground photos.
[One paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10382) claims 94–97% on lawn measurement
but releases no dataset or model and does not state its imagery, so it is not a
benchmark. **Nothing off-the-shelf does residential lawn from the air.**

### E5. OAM-TCD is a tree model at exactly our resolution
Restor's tree crown delineation: **10 cm/px**, globally diverse OpenAerialMap
imagery, 5,072 tiles, 280k labelled trees. Per-pixel **tree / no-tree**. Open
weights: `restor/tcd-unet-r34`, `restor/tcd-unet-r50`. Loads with
`segmentation_models_pytorch` in three lines.

### E6. Licensing of the candidates
The owner has said non-commercial is acceptable. Recorded anyway because it
constrains any later change of mind.

| | licence | commercial? |
|---|---|---|
| Scale-MAE (torchgeo) | CC-BY-NC-4.0 | no |
| Restor TCD U-Nets | CC-BY-NC (CC-BY planned) | not yet |
| SatlasPretrain / NAIP | ODC-BY | yes |
| Chesapeake U-Net (torchgeo) | MIT | yes |

## SPECULATION — theories not yet tested

Marked so they are not later quoted as findings.

### ~~S1. Resolution mismatch is what caps Scale-MAE~~ — CONFIRMED, now H9
Tested 2026-09-19 and **supported**: 672px → 896px improved the eye-only row by
8.2 points against an unchanged control. Promoted to H9.

The open part: **896 is the largest size the workflow offers.** Whether the
gain continues past it is untested, and the frames themselves are 1280px, so
there is headroom in the source before anything has to be re-fetched.

### S7. Why does colour HURT once the eye is good?
H9's second finding, unexplained. At 672px "both" beat the eye alone; at 896px
the eye alone beats every combination.

Candidates, none tested:
- **Dimensionality.** More features against 23 lawns, so the extra columns fit
  noise. Would predict that the gap narrows as the corpus grows.
- **The squeeze.** Colour is 11 raw numbers; the eye is projected down to 32 or
  96. Mixing raw and projected features may be scaling them badly against each
  other.
- **Redundancy.** A backbone reading this well may already encode what colour
  says, so colour adds only its failure mode — shadow.

Worth resolving, because it decides whether the published model should carry
colour at all.

### S2. A tree mask would help more than another backbone
E5 gives a tree/no-tree probability per pixel at our resolution. Our biggest
confusion is woods vs lawn — H8's Kent benchmark is mostly woods. Feeding tree
probability as a feature might do what the ring failed to do: supply context,
but *learned and at the right scale* rather than raw colour samples.
**Untested, and the ring's failure is a reason for caution, not confidence.**

### S3. The corpus, not the features, is the binding constraint
H7 says one map is worth up to 10 points; the gap to SAM is about 10 points.
That is suspicious. **Untested** — the crossover point is unknown, and "more
data will fix it" is the most over-claimed sentence in machine learning.

### S4. The inferred column needs far more marked ground to be readable
H6 puts it at 3% of a typical map. **Untested.** It is not known how much
marking is enough.

### S5. The shade/sun split may currently be noise
Under DINOv2 every configuration was *better* in shade, which is implausible.
Under Scale-MAE at 672px the signs were mixed. At 896px **four of six
configurations are again "better in shade"**, including colour-only, which
cannot be reading anything but brightness.

Three runs, no stable story, and one reading that is close to impossible.
**Treat the shade/sun columns as unreliable until investigated.** Not
investigated.

## Rules for running and reading these experiments

1. **Check the fingerprint and lawn count first.** Two tables from two corpora
   are not comparable (H7).
2. **Use a backbone-free row as the control** when the corpus has changed.
3. **Do not trust a difference under about 10 points** at this corpus size.
4. **Keep the Kent benchmark** (H8). It is the hard case on purpose.
5. **What /predictions.html shows is the TRACE, and it answers a different
   question from the table.** The table asks how accurate the model is. The
   pictures ask whether a person could fix its outline faster than drawing one
   — which is the question that decides whether a not-yet-good model can start
   doing the tracing and make the corpus grow faster (S3). Those two can
   disagree completely: 30% wrong in one clean sweep is two brush strokes,
   while 15% wrong as a hundred crumbs along every boundary is worse than an
   empty map. So read the **piece and handle counts** beside each picture, not
   only the error figure. The outline is drawn with the app's own tracer
   settings (`TRACE_TOLERANCE_M`, `MAX_TRACE_VERTICES` in `public/lib/mask.js`)
   so it is the shape the drawing tools would actually receive, and the scraps
   the tracer binned are reported because they are invisible by definition.

   Before 2026-09-19 these pictures were a disagreement map — red for missed,
   orange for over-called. That answered the accuracy question the table
   already answers, and could not answer the editing one at all.
6. **The advice printed at the end of the run is code, and code can be stale.**
   It once explained a Scale-MAE result with a sentence about models trained on
   ground-level photographs — true of DINOv2, false of what had run, and it
   recommended as the next step the thing the run had just done. Fixed on
   2026-09-19, but read the advice as a helper, not as an oracle.
