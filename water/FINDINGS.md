# What we know about water on a lawn

**The water tool's memory (water session).** Read it before changing a
threshold or interpreting a result, and add to it after every measurement.

Same rules as docs/DETECTOR-FINDINGS.md, which this file copies the form of:

- **HARD FINDING** — measured here (with how to repeat it), or measured by
  the core session and said so, or cited with a link.
- **SPECULATION** — a theory that fits and has not been tested. It may be
  worth acting on. It is not worth asserting.
- **THE PLAN** — what the owner decided. A decision, not a result.
- **THE BAR** — what a step must reach, written down BEFORE it is measured.

Every finding carries its date and what it was measured on. Addresses never
go in this file (or anywhere in the repository): lots are named by a label.

## Where things stand

*Kept current so a fresh session can pick up without the conversation.*

- **Step 1, the low-spot map, works offline** (2026-10-16): water/lib/ reads
  a lot's lidar from the public octrees, builds a 1 m ground surface, finds
  roofs, fills low spots, traces runoff and measures the ground beside each
  building, in 2-5 s a lot. `node water/tools/lowspots.mjs` with WATER_LOTS;
  workflow "Water" runs it and the tests.
- **What it can see is now measured on made-up ground (H8), not yet on real
  wet spots.** Roughly: a spot holding 5 cm or more of water, 8 m or more
  across, is found most of the time; anything 3 m across, or holding under
  3 cm, is not. The field check (THE BAR below) has not happened.
- **Waiting on the owner:** which lots, and the first real rain.

## THE PLAN (owner, 2026-10-15; relayed by the core session 2026-10-16)

Model how rain and irrigation behave on one lawn, so a person can tune their
watering and see problems worth fixing. "I don't want to do it if it can't
work well, and it has to be nearly free." Each step passes a bar written
down before it is measured, or the work stops and says so.

1. Low-spot map (lidar ground -> surface -> filled depressions, flow, grade
   beside the house), checked against the owner's GPS photos of standing
   water after a real rain.
2. A watering schedule per zone: a daily water balance, calibrated by a
   can-and-ruler soak test, checked against a soil moisture meter.
3. Recommendations, only for what 1 and 2 have proven, worded "likely" until
   a soak test confirms them.

## THE BAR for step 1 (owner's suggestion, written 2026-10-16, before any field data)

- At least **7 of 10 real wet spots found**, and at least **7 of 10 reported
  spots really wet**, over the lots the owner checks after the next real rain.
- "Found" means a reported spot whose wet area comes within **5 m** of the
  photo's GPS position (a phone's fix is good to 3-5 m under open sky).
  "Really wet" means standing water or ground that squishes underfoot inside
  or within 5 m of the reported spot.
- Only spots on the lot count, and only spots the map can be asked about:
  the photo has to be on open ground the lidar saw (not under a deck, not
  where the house has been extended since the flight).
- Fixed before the check: the kernel (0.8 m), MIN_DEPTH 3 cm, MIN_AREA 4 m^2,
  and the noise floor rule (lib/lowspots.js). If the check fails, say so;
  re-tuning on the same photos and re-scoring them is not a pass.

## HARD FINDINGS

### H1. Lidar ground density and scatter (core session, 2026-10-15/16)

USGS 3DEP, the same Entwine octrees the shade map reads; ground is class 2.
On 11 corpus lots: **1-9 ground points per m^2**. The points within each 1 m
cell scatter **1.2-3.5 cm** (median standard deviation). So a low spot needs
to be at least ~2 m across and 3-5 cm deep to tell from noise. Swath seams
could be checked on only one flight (a **2 cm step**), because Entwine keeps
a single point_source_id on most clouds. The lidar is as old as its flight;
regrading since then is invisible.

### H2. The soil survey over the corpus (core session, 2026-10-15/16)

USDA Soil Data Access (https://sdmdataaccess.sc.egov.usda.gov/Tabular/post.rest,
SQL with SDA_Get_Mukey_from_intersection_with_WktWgs84). Of the 104 locked
corpus lots (tools/locked-lawns.json): **103 have a named soil with a
drainage class**; 24 are "Urban land-X complexes" with a named soil listed;
1 is Urban land only. Drainage class of the top component: **51 well, 21
moderately well, 15 poorly, 8 somewhat poorly, 4 somewhat excessively, 2
very poorly, 2 excessively drained.** **53 have a water-table depth**
(muaggatt.wtdepannmin). The top horizon carries ksat_r (um/s), awc_r, sand
and clay. CAVEAT: the survey maps the native soil; a lawn is usually graded
fill and compacted topsoil, so infiltration can be far below the survey's
ksat.

### H3. Groundwater wells (core session, 2026-10-15/16)

USGS NWIS lists **zero active groundwater wells** over roughly Holland to
Ionia. The practical substitute is the soil survey's water-table depth.

### H4. Weather and storms (core session, 2026-10-15/16)

NASA POWER daily, no key: PRECTOTCORR, T2M, RH2M, WS2M, ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN,
EVPTRNS -- enough for FAO-56 reference ET. NWS has the forecast. POWER's
rain is a coarse grid that misses local storms; until Turf Tools answers
(https://claude.ai/artifact/QDLx1YVwoysn1XysfGt3rS), a user enters their own
gauge or controller totals. NOAA Atlas 14 storm sizes answer with no key,
e.g. https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/new/cgi_readH5.py?lat=..&lon=..&type=pf&data=intensity&units=english&series=pds

### H5. Shade (core session, 2026-10-16)

The shade map's per-cell light is readable from the live site (its public
/api/shade/* routes and modules under /shade/). Shaded turf uses less water.

### H6. The first three West Michigan points (water session, 2026-10-16)

Three development points (a Hudsonville-area street, a Wyoming-area street,
central Grandville; coordinates not kept), each a 50 m lot plus 40 m round
it, read by water/tools/lowspots.mjs:

| flight (octree)                       | flown (laser clock) | ground pts/m^2 over open ground | scatter* | noise floor |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|-----|--------|--------|
| USGS_LPC_MI_31Co_Ottawa_2016_LAS_2019 | 2017-11-26          | 2.90 | 3.6 cm | 4.4 cm |
| USGS_LPC_MI_31Co_Kent_2016_LAS_2019   | 2017-11-26          | 3.38 | 3.0 cm | 3.3 cm |
| USGS_LPC_MI_31Co_Kent_2016_LAS_2019   | 2017-11-27          | 1.70 | 3.5 cm | 4.3 cm |

\* median standard deviation of the ground points within 2 m of each cell
(lib/surface.js `sd`). This includes the ground's own slope and texture
across those 4 m, so it reads higher than H1's within-1 m-cell figure.

- **Neither octree classes buildings.** All three boxes held classes 1, 2
  and 7 only (e.g. 16,863 ground, 9,498 unclassified, 6 noise in the first
  Kent box; 42,568 / 54,666 / 18 in the Ottawa one). Roofs are
  found from the points instead (lib/surface.js): no ground, 2 m+ up,
  80%+ single returns. Looked right on all three maps by eye; not measured.
- **Both flights are late November**, leaves off: ground under deciduous
  trees is seen. (USGS's own dates for these work units run Nov 2017 - May
  2018, and the datum correction uses that window's middle.)
- Each lot took 2-5 s on one CPU, the network included.

### H7. Noise alone digs low spots several error bars deep (water session, 2026-10-16)

On flat made-up ground (1.2 ground pts/m^2, 2 cm scatter, 80 m square), the
filled surface showed spurious spots 2.3-2.8 cm deep whose own error bars
(the bottom's and the rim's standard errors combined) were 1.2-1.8 cm.
Filling picks the lowest bottom and the highest spill path the noise offers,
so "depth over its error bar" is not a test: a 3-sigma rule passed noise.
Replaced by a noise floor measured per flight (lib/lowspots.js noiseFloor):
eight runs of flat ground with the lot's own density and scatter; a real spot
must be deeper than the deepest spot noise dug in any of them.

### H8. What the map can find, on made-up ground (water session, 2026-10-16)

`SEEDS=10 node water/tools/limits.mjs`. Smooth dishes 3-12 m across and
3-12 cm deep, on flat ground and ground falling 0.5% and 1%, alone in a 50 m
lot, 10 noise seeds each; binned by the water each dish REALLY holds (a dish
on a slope spills on its low side). Share of dishes reported, with the
number of trials:

    1.2 ground pts/m^2, 2.5 cm scatter: noise floor 4.2 cm, 0.017 false spots per lot
      water held      3 m      5 m      8 m     12 m across

      3.0-4.5 cm   0% (20)  0% (10)  0% (20)     -
      4.5-6.5 cm   0% (20) 10% (20) 65% (20) 85% (20)
      6.5-9.0 cm   5% (20) 40% (20) 95% (20) 85% (20)
      9.0-20 cm   23% (30) 70% (30)100% (20)100% (20)

      6.5-9.0 cm   0% (20)  5% (20) 55% (20) 50% (20)

      9.0-20 cm   40% (30) 97% (30)100% (20)100% (20)

    3 ground pts/m^2, 3.5 cm scatter: noise floor 3.0 cm, 0.015 false spots per lot
      2.0-3.0 cm   0% (20)  0% (20) 20% (10) 47% (30)

      9.0-20 cm   37% (30) 97% (30)100% (20)100% (20)

Read plainly: **on these flights a spot 3 m across is nearly invisible, a
spot 5 m across is a coin toss unless it holds 7 cm or more, and a spot 8 m
or more across holding 5 cm or more is found most of the time.** Noise
alone makes under 2 false spots per 100 lots. The reported depth runs
shallow -- smoothing takes 1-3 cm off -- so a reported depth is a "at least".

Also measured and NOT adopted: a narrower kernel for denser flights (sigma
down to 0.5 m at 3 pts/m^2). At 2.5 cm scatter it helped (5 m spots holding
4.5-6.5 cm: 35% -> 50%); at 3.5 cm, which is what the real lots show (H6),
it hurt (the same row: 40% -> 10%; 5 m, 6.5-9 cm: 80% -> 45%), because the
noise floor rose faster than the spots got deeper.

These are made-up dishes in Gaussian noise. Real ground has texture, swath
seams (H1: a 2 cm step), and things that are not ground at all; real
detection will be lower and false spots higher. H8 is the ceiling, not the
forecast.

## SPECULATION

### S1. Many real wet spots may not be low spots at all

Ground that stays wet because the soil is compacted or poorly drained (H2:
25 of 103 corpus lots are poorly to very poorly drained, natively), because
a downspout empties there, or because a spot under 5 m across holds water
(H8: invisible), will not be on a lidar low-spot map. If so, the "7 of 10
real wet spots found" bar is at risk from step 1 alone, and the soil (step
2's soak test, H2) carries part of the answer. Untested: the field check is
what tests it.

### S2. Storm inlets and yard drains will look like ponds

A catch basin or yard drain sits in a low spot by design and drains it
through a pipe the lidar cannot see. The first maps show water "standing"
along curbs and at street low points. On a lawn, a reported spot with a
drain grate in it is a false positive of this kind; the field check should
note grates.

### S3. The noise floor is cautious on sloping yards

It is measured on flat noise (the worst case), and the scatter it uses
includes each cell's own slope (H6 footnote). Both push the floor up on a
sloping lot. Not measured how much recall that costs.

### S4. Roofs found from the points

The roof rule (no ground, 2 m+ up, mostly single returns) looked right on
three maps by eye. Not measured against footprints. A low-hanging conifer
with no ground under it could pass as a roof; a flat roof covered by
overhanging bare branches could fail.
